MicroViews is a JavaScript library that allows web content authors to easily add platform specific views of EPrints documents to their websites. These include tooltips, mobile views and inline previews.

Development

If you want to test the MicroViews library on your local machine then run bin/server. You must run the server from the top level project folder (i.e. the directory containing this README) and the server assumes the existence of a build folder.

Project Structure

bin - This folder contains any scripts to help with building MicroViews.

build - This folder is ignored from version control but it used as the document root for the MicroViews development server.

lib/html - Any html to use in conjunction with the development web server.

lib/js - Any javascript to use in conjunction with the development web server.

src - This is the source for the MicroViews library.
